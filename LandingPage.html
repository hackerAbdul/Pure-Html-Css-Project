            <h2 id="history">Who am I</h2>
            <p>To stop you from getting bored essentially I am 24 year old lad who likes to code.<br>
            Now some say that is nerdy but to me its just something I like. I first got into this for the money <br>
            you know we choose subjects at uni that we think will get a good <strong>career.</strong></p>
            <p>Computer Science was that to me starting off & it took alot of hours to get into it.<br> 
            I did not like coding at first infact I struggled with the understanding of it. I loved maths only and good thing theres loads of maths involved.<br>
            Trust me you will learn about the maths part in abit. But its mostly because of logic surrounding it.<br>
            Even until now I am not the best coder just experienced enough to know how to code properly</p>

            <h2 id="studies">My Studies</h2>
